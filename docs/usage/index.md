{%set project = "Setup" %}

# {{ project }} Documentation <!-- omit in toc -->

The {{ project }} Documentation is a collection of setup guides, snippets, templates, and other useful information that the {{ project }} team has gathered over the years and found useful.

The wish for this project is to have the best step-by-step guides for setting up a computer for development, with different operating systems, languages, and ides.

The main focus at this point is macOS with the arm64 architecture, python and C# using Visual Studio Code as the IDE.
