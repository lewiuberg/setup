# Setup Documentation <!-- omit in toc -->

The Setup Documentation is a collection of setup guides, snippets, templates, and other useful information that the Setup team has gathered over the years and found useful.

The wish for this project is to have the best step-by-step guides for setting up a computer for development, with different operating systems, languages, and ides.

The main focus at this point is macOS with the arm64 architecture, python and C# using Visual Studio Code as the IDE.
