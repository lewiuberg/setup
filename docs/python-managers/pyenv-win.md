Pyenv-win is a Python version management tool for Windows. It is a port of the popular [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) tool for Unix-like systems. It allows you to easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It is simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well.

## Install Pyenv-win

[ðŸ”—](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win/blob/master/docs/installation.md#chocolatey)

Open a PowerShell window as an **administrator** and run the following command:

```powershell
choco install pyenv-win -y
```

Add the system environment variables PYENV, PYENV_HOME and PYENV_ROOT to your Environment Variables by running the following commands in PowerShell:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PYENV',$env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\","User")

[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PYENV_ROOT',$env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\","User")

[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('PYENV_HOME',$env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\","User")
```

Then add the paths to USER PATH to be able to use the commands. In PowerShell, run the following command:

```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('path', $env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\bin;" + $env:USERPROFILE + "\.pyenv\pyenv-win\shims;" + [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('path', "User"),"User")
```

To enable pyenv-win to run scripts in PowerShell, run the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

If you cant set the Execution Policy by running PowerShell as Administrator, you can set it under the current user scope by running the following command:[^1]

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Install the Python version you want to use in your project. For example, to install Python 3.10.5, run the following command:

```powershell
pyenv install 3.10.5
```

After it is installed navigate to the root of your project and run the following command to set the local Python version:

```powershell
pyenv local 3.10.5
```

A file named `.python-version` will be created in the root of your project. This file contains the Python version that will be used when you run the `python` command in your project.

Now, to test that the desired Python version is being used, run the following command:

```powershell
python --version
```

You should see the following output:

```powershell
Python 3.10.5
```
